*This project website serves as a presentation of my work for my Music 147 class.
The following entries are my weekly assingments.*

### *Assignment #1: Using My Name to Type Sound Files*
In this max patch, certain keys of the keyboard are mapped to a 29-key virtual piano.
If you press any of those keys, the corresponding note will sound. For a list of the
mappings, please see the documentation within the patch.

### *Assignment #2: Further Exploration of Sound Files*
Here, I've created a simple program that allows the user to apply effects to a file 
of their choice. For complete documentation, please see the Max Patch.

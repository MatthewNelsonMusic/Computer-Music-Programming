*This project website serves as a presentation of my work for my Music 147 class.
The following entries are my weekly assignments.*

### *Assignment #1: Using My Name to Type Sound Files*
In this max patch, certain keys of the keyboard are mapped to a 29-key virtual piano.
If you press any of those keys, the corresponding note will sound. For a list of the
mappings, please see the documentation within the patch.

### *Assignment #2: Further Exploration of Sound Files*
Here, I've created a simple program that allows the user to apply effects to a file
of their choice. For complete documentation, please see the Max Patch.

### *Assignment #3: Using MIDI to Control Sound*
In this patch, I've made it so I can use my mouse as a pitch wheel. Right now, the patch is most likely hard wired to
my own mouse, but it's possible to develop it so that more mouse types can be included.

### *Assignment #4: Algorithmic Composition*
This is a basic ear training program. For most of the program, I use *coll* objects to store the midi numbers
for chords. On the hardest level, I use the chaos algorithm (x=rx(1-x)) to produce bass notes for the chords, then I
use the *random* object to build the notes on top of the bass. If I were to develop this further, I would include a mode that
shows the chord symbol for what chord the program is playing.
